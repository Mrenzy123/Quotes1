# Quotes1
# BY Deborah MWANGANJYE

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.2.2.
This project is to create an application where users can create quotes and have those quotes voted on whether they are terrible or are inspirational.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
